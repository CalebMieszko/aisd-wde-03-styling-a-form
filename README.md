[Demo: Applying Basic Styles]

Now that you have linked your stylesheet, let's see how to apply some basic styles with a quick demo. 
Your instructor will demonstrate using their code editor and terminal to create a new local repository with index.html, styles.css, and signup-styles.css files. They will link them as we learned earlier and use simple HTML content before applying the CSS steps below.
[Styles.css | Styling the Body]
Setting the background color and font properties for the entire page in `styles.css` ensures a consistent look and feel. 
body {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  color: #333;
}
The background color helps to reduce eye strain, and the font family ensures that the text is easy to read.
[Styles.css |Styling Headings]
To make headings stand out, define different font sizes and colors.
h1 {
  font-size: 2em;
  color: #4CAF50;
}

h2 {
  font-size: 1.5em;
  color: #2196F3;
}
This hierarchy in text styles helps users quickly understand the structure and importance of the content.

[Styles.css | Styling Paragraphs]
Ensuring paragraphs have good readability involves setting an appropriate line height and spacing.
p {
  line-height: 1.6;
  margin-bottom: 1em;
}
The margin-bottom property adds space between paragraphs, preventing them from appearing too cluttered.

Setting the background color and font properties for the entire page in `styles.css` ensures a consistent look and feel.
